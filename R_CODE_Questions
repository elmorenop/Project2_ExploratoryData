## 1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

#Aggregate the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years
aggTotals <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,NEI, sum)

#Plot the total PM2.5 emission from all sources

barplot(
  (aggTotals$Emissions)/10^6,
  names.arg=aggTotals$year,
  xlab="Year",
  ylab="PM2.5 Emissions (10^6 Tons)",
  main="Total PM2.5 Emissions From All US Sources"
)

## 2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?

#Total emissions have decreased in the US from 1999 to 2008.

## 3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the \color{red}{\verb|type|}type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

# R_Code

library(ggplot2)
ggp <- ggplot(baltimoreNEI,aes(factor(year),Emissions,fill=type)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  theme_bw() + guides(fill=FALSE)+
  facet_grid(.~type,scales = "free",space="free") + 
  labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (Tons)")) + 
  labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Emissions, Baltimore City 1999-2008 by Source Type"))
print(ggp)

# The non-road, nonpoint, on-road source types have all seen decreased emissions overall from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City.
# The point source saw a slight increase overall from 1999-2008. Also note that the point source saw a significant increase until 2005 at which point it decreases again by 2008 to just above the starting values.

## 4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

# R_Code
#Subset coal combustion related NEI data
combustionRelated <- grepl("comb", SCC$SCC.Level.One, ignore.case=TRUE)
coalRelated <- grepl("coal", SCC$SCC.Level.Four, ignore.case=TRUE) 
coalCombustion <- (combustionRelated & coalRelated)
combustionSCC <- SCC[coalCombustion,]$SCC
combustionNEI <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% combustionSCC,]
library(ggplot2)
ggp <- ggplot(combustionNEI,aes(factor(year),Emissions/10^5)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="grey",width=0.75) +
  theme_bw() +  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (10^5 Tons)")) + 
  labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Coal Combustion Source Emissions Across US from 1999-2008"))
print(ggp)

#Emissions from coal combustion related sources have decreased from 6 * 10^6 to below 4 * 10^6 from 1999-2008.

## 5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

#R_Code
vehicles <- grepl("vehicle", SCC$SCC.Level.Two, ignore.case=TRUE)
vehiclesSCC <- SCC[vehicles,]$SCC
vehiclesNEI <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% vehiclesSCC,]
baltimoreVehiclesNEI <- vehiclesNEI[vehiclesNEI$fips==24510,]
library(ggplot2)
ggp <- ggplot(baltimoreVehiclesNEI,aes(factor(year),Emissions)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="grey",width=0.75) +
  theme_bw() +  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (10^5 Tons)")) + 
  labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Motor Vehicle Source Emissions in Baltimore from 1999-2008"))
print(ggp)

#Emissions from motor vehicle sources have dropped from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City

## 6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (\color{red}{\verb|fips == "06037"|}fips=="06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

#R_Code
vehiclesBaltimoreNEI <- vehiclesNEI[vehiclesNEI$fips == 24510,]
vehiclesBaltimoreNEI$city <- "Baltimore City"
vehiclesLANEI <- vehiclesNEI[vehiclesNEI$fips=="06037",]
vehiclesLANEI$city <- "Los Angeles County"
bothNEI <- rbind(vehiclesBaltimoreNEI,vehiclesLANEI)
library(ggplot2)
ggp <- ggplot(bothNEI, aes(x=factor(year), y=Emissions, fill=city)) +
 geom_bar(aes(fill=year),stat="identity") +
 facet_grid(scales="free", space="free", .~city) +
 guides(fill=FALSE) + theme_bw() +
 labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (Kilo-Tons)")) + 
 labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Motor Vehicle Source Emissions in Baltimore & LA, 1999-2008"))
print(ggp)

#Los Angeles County has seen the greatest changes over time in motor vehicle emissions.
